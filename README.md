# Clockify-it

Clockify-it is a customizable and extensible bridge between clockify and other time tracking / management tools written in dotnet.

## State of the project

Since this is just a side-project, I'll work on features and fixes when I have spare time.

Don't expect the application to be fully tested. **It is not considered to be production ready** even I'm aiming to use it personally.
